## Overview
The **FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air)** project is designed to enable wireless updates of firmware for embedded devices. This ensures devices stay up-to-date with the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements without the need for manual intervention or physical access.

## Features
- Secure wireless transmission of firmware updates.
- Robust error-checking and rollback mechanisms.
- Lightweight and resource-efficient protocol for embedded systems.
- Compatibility with various communication technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, Zigbee).
- Support for multiple target devices and version management.

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:
1. **Firmware Server**:
   - Hosts the firmware files.
   - Manages device requests and delivers appropriate updates.
2. **Embedded Device**:
   - Requests updates and applies them securely.
   - Implements rollback mechanisms in case of failures.
3. **Communication Protocol**:
   - Handles secure data transfer between the server and the devices.

*Replace with your actual architecture diagram.*

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller with at least 64KB Flash and 16KB RAM.
- Wireless communication module (e.g., ESP8266, nRF52832).
- Power supply and connectivity hardware (e.g., antennas, sensors, cables).

## Software Requirements
- Programming Environment: [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html), [Keil uVision](https://www.keil.com/), or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
- Libraries and Drivers:
  - Secure Sockets API.
  - OTA-specific libraries (e.g., MQTT, HTTP, or custom protocol).
- Firmware versioning tool (e.g., [SemVer](https://semver.org/)).

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FOTA-Project.git
   cd FOTA-Project
   ```
2. Configure the server settings in `config.h`:
   ```c
   #define SERVER_URL "http://firmware-server.com"
   #define DEVICE_ID "12345"
   ```
3. Compile and flash the initial firmware to the device.
4. Set up the firmware server:
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install flask requests
     ```
   - Run the server:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
5. Test the setup using provided test scripts.

## Usage
1. Power on the embedded device.
2. Connect the device to the network.
3. Trigger the update process (manual or periodic).
4. Monitor logs to ensure the update is successful.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The device checks its current firmware version.
2. **Request Update**: Sends a request to the server for updates.
3. **Download and Verify**: Downloads the update, verifies its integrity using checksum or signature.
4. **Apply Update**: Reboots into a bootloader to apply the update.
5. **Post-Update Validation**: Ensures the firmware is functional, else rolls back to the previous version.

## Testing and Validation
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Verify individual components (e.g., checksum validation, communication protocol).
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test communication between the server and device.
- **Stress Tests**:
  - Simulate large-scale updates with multiple devices.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for delta updates to minimize data transfer.
- Implement advanced security features (e.g., TLS, E2E encryption).
- Extend compatibility to additional communication protocols.
- Add a user-friendly dashboard for managing updates.
